### UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO AUTOMATION & MECHATRONICS

#### AUTOMATION
**Definition**: It is technology concerned with the application of Mechanical,
electronic & computer-based systems to operate and control production in
order to improves productions.

#### TYPE OF AUTOMATION
1) Fixed Automation
2) Programmable Automation
3) Flexible Automation

#### HYDRAULIC SYSTEM
Hydraulic systems are power-transmitting assemblies employing pressurized liquid as a fluid for transmitting energy from an energy-generating source to an energy-using point to accomplish useful work

#### PNEUMATIC SYSTEM
A pneumatic system carries power by employing compressed gas, generally air, as a fluid for transmitting energy from an energy-generating source to an energy-using point to accomplish useful work.

#### AUTOMATED FLOW LINES
It consists of several machines or workstations which are linked together by work handling devices that transfer parts between the stations. The transfer of work parts occurs automatically and the workstations carry out their specialized functions automatically.

#### TYPES OF FLOW LINES
• **In-line type:** The in-line configuration consists of a sequence of workstations in a more or less straight-line arrangement as shown in below Figure. An example of an in-line transfer machine used for metal cutting operations.

**• Segmented in-line Type :** The segmented in-line configuration consists of two or more straight line arrangement which are usually perpendicular to each other with L shaped or U shaped or rectangular shaped as shown in below Figure. The flow of work can take a few 90°turns, either for workpiece reorientation, factory layout limitations, or other reasons, and still qualify as a straight-line configuration.

**• Rotary type:** In the rotary configuration, the work parts are indexed around a circular table or dial. The workstations are stationary and usually located around the outside periphery of the dial. The parts ride on the rotating table and arc registered or positioned, in turn, at each station for
its processing or assembly operation. This type of equipment is often referred to as an indexing machine or dial index machine and the configuration is shown in below.

#### METHODS OF WORK PART TRANSPORT
- Continuous transfer
- Intermittent or synchronous transfer
- Asynchronous or power-and-free transfer

#### TRANSFER MECHANISMS
**1. Linear transfer mechanisms**
The commonly used linear transfer mechanisms are:
a) Walking beam transfer bar system,
b) Powered roller conveyor system, and
c) Chain-drive conveyor system

**2. Rotary transfer mechanisms**
There are several methods used to index a circular table or dial at various equal angular positions corresponding to workstation locations.
a) Rack and pinion
b) Ratchet and pawl
c) Geneva mechanism
d) CAM Mechanisms

#### WALKING BEAM SYSTEMS
Walking beam transfer mechanism, the
work-parts are lifted up from their
workstation locations by a transfer bar
and moved one position ahead, to the
next station. The transfer bar then lowers
the pans into nests which position them
more accurately for processing. For
speed and accuracy, the motion of the
beam is most often generated by a
rotating camshaft powered by an electric
motor or a roller movement in a profile
powered by hydraulic cylinder

#### POWERED ROLLER CONVEYOR SYSTEM
The conveyor can be used to move pans or pallets possessing flat riding surfaces. The rollers can be powered by either of two mechanisms. The first is a belt drive, in which a flat moving belt beneath the rollers provides the
rotation of the rollers by friction. A chain drive is the second common mechanism used to power the rollers. Powered roller conveyors are versatile transfer systems because they can be used to divert work pallets into workstations or alternate tracks.

#### CHAIN-DRIVE CONVEYOR SYSTEM
In chain-drive conveyor system either a chain or a flexible steel belt is used to transport the work carriers. The chain is driven by pulleys in either an "over-and under" configuration, in which the pulleys turn about a horizontal axis, or an "around-the-corner" configuration, in which the pulleys rotate
about a vertical axis.

#### RACK AND PINION
This mechanism is simple but is not considered especially suited to the high-speed operation often associated with indexing machines. The device is pictured in the below Figure and uses a piston to drive the rack, which causes the pinion gear and attached indexing table to rotate, A clutch or
other device is used to provide rotation in the desired direction.

#### RATCHET AND PAWL
A ratchet is a device that allows linear or rotary motion in only one direction, while preventing motion in the opposite direction. Ratchets consist of a gearwheel and a pivoting spring-loaded finger called a pawl that engages the teeth. Either the teeth, or the pawl, are slanted at an angle, so that when the teeth are moving in one direction, the pawl slides
up and over each tooth in turn, with the spring forcing it back with a 'click' into the depression before the next tooth. When the teeth are moving in the other direction, the angle of the pawl causes it to catch against a tooth and stop further motion in that direction.

#### GENEVA MECHANISM
The Geneva mechanism uses a continuously rotating driver to index the table, as pictured below. If the driven member has six slots for a six-station dial indexing machine, each turn of the driver will cause the table to advance one-sixth of a turn. The driver only causes movement of the table through a
portion of its rotation. For a six-slotted driven member, 120° of a complete rotation of the driver is used to index the table. The other 240° is dwell. For a four slotted driven member, the ratio would be 90° for index and 270° for dwell. The usual number of indexing per revolution of the table is four, five,
six, and eight.

#### CAM MECHANISMS
Various forms of cam mechanism, an example of which is illustrated in the below Figure, provide probably the most accurate and reliable method of indexing the dial. They are in widespread use in industry despite the fact that the cost is relatively high compared to alternative mechanisms. The cam can be designed to give a variety of velocity and dwell characteristics.

#### CONTROL FUNCTIONS
Controlling an automated flow line is a complex problem, owing to the sheer number of sequential steps that must be carried out. There are three main functions that are utilized to control the operation of an automatic transfer system.
– The first of these is an operational requirement
– The second is a safety requirement, and
– The third is dedicated to improving quality.
